# This is about my journey at IT since as a kid, until now at Software Development.


I always love to know how the things work.

Back at 5 years old, I used to get old electronic damaged stuff so I could open and look the insides.
It was really fascinating for me to discover what human inventions could do. It looks like another world, just in front of my eyes.

At 12, I moved. Once, living in Rio downtown, now I got myself into the Rio de Janeiro State eastern area, known as "Região dos Lagos".
Even in that situation, after some years later my childplay with electronics, my dream was pretty fresh still.
And now, a challenge came to me: look after a course.

Unfortunately, the things were pretty difficult for me, when we talk about "study opportunities". I couldnt find any courses in electronics
to do, so I began quitting bit a bit as time was passing by.

When I less expected, some my mothers friend suggested me to begin to IT, starting by a Basic Windows course. He told me electronics wasnt so
needed in market, and told me to "expand my horizons for the future with IT".

So I began the course. It was my first time looking into a PC screen. It was magic for me: got absolutely fascinated and in love with that.
The course last for 8 months and after that I was qualified to operate a computer and an operating system. But it was a small thing for me. I wanted more.

So my next one was "Assembly and maintenance of computers", a popular course in Brazil in order to know how to install, configure, deploy and repair
hardware and OSes.
I really studied pretty hard. The time was 2002, a time when in Brazil the most popular PC was an AMD Sempron 2300 or an Intel Pentium 4. But, in the
course, my labs were with a K6-II 500Mhz or Pentium III-MMX. And I didn't even had a computer in my house; even internet was a privilege of few.

I finished the course at the end of that year, and I got a SIS 386SX-S by present. Yes, a 386. It has 8MB (MEGABYTES) of RAM and Windows 95.
I learned so many things with this guy! I edited manually memory addresses for memory expanded (it was not native on Windows), adjusted manually
a motherboard using jumpers - BIOS hasn't some basic features we see today; the oldschool know what I am talking about - and installed an Windows using
diskettes. I am so happy and proud of myself for doing this all alone, just using old books from City Library. And I was just 13!
At the end, I tuned it to have 16MB RAM and Windows 98 SE. 

As the time was passing, I experienced and learned a lot, doing some jobs like calculating the budget for new systems, hardware installation,
network infrastructure and so. Worked a lot in some PC repairing shops. I always loved my job. A statement I have for my life is: "you dont have to look
for a job who make you happy before you see the happy sides of your job." I mean, we just have to look the happiness in what we do now, don't matter what
we do, right?

I always kept studying and making some free online courses. In 2005, made a course at Estácio de Sá University called "Programming Logic". At that time,
the only thing I knew is programming is a strange and weird wizardry who makes software work correctly. So I entered the course without knowing exactly
what I could learn out there.

And there, at the University, I felt that feeling again. That fascinating crush about a thing. And that thing was the algorithms, the pseudocode, and the
basics of programming.

A brand new world opened to me. Now, I was feeling like programming could do anything. So I became studying VisualBasic. To be honest, in that time, with 16
years old, I took it as a something too hard. I even did some codes to simple things, but nothing spetacular.

At 2009, I made a public exam to get a scholarship discount at a private University course. I got 13rd against more than 20000 candidates. Finally I was prepared
to do my Information Systems bachelor degree. That was one of the best moments of my life.

I was one of the top students of the course, and of the university. My best grades was in "Programming I" (who we study and learn C, C++ and C#), "Algorithms" and
"Computing History".

It was being hard to stand the costs tough. Even receiving discount, I was paying the transport, food, copied material...

But, the worst happened and caught me by surprise. My mother got sick at the end of my first semester. With my most precious person in life sick, and spenting
too much money with her treatment, I couldn't think twice: I had to give up my course in order to save some money for her. I don't regret it, but... It was hard.

Almost 1 year later, my mother got a bit well, but I had other spenses and I couldn't go back to University. So I keep studying online for myself until the present.

In 2007 I got some wonderful job opportunity: work with IT Infrastructure at Randstad Techonlogies, in service to Accenture, in São Paulo. 

I travelled from Rio to São Paulo then, with some clothes and my notebook, and nothing else. I just love challenges and I couldn't let scape this lucky chance.

I was approved in my job interview and this made me so glad! Began working at LATAM Airlines, working on preparing maintening and deploy Desktops, Notebooks and
Ticket terminals in airports. 3 months later, I went to another project: Lactalis do Brasil, when I am currently, giving support to facilities and offices around
Brazil. I also deploy and custom Windows Systems using Microsoft recommended tools, as MDT, Windows SIM, editing XML files, batch files, PowerShell scripts, using
DISM etc.

But I want more. I want more challenge and I want to grow up. So, now, I'm studying the basics of programming and also Java since february, and I'm hoping to find someone
who is interested in invest on me, giving me a job or some way to get experience so I can work with software development.
